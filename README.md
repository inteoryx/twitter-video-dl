# twitter-video-dl
Download twitter videos as mp4 files without API key, ffmpeg, or anything but python and a url.

# Usage
1. Clone the repo.
2. See a video on twitter that you want to save.
3. Invoke the script, e.g.: python twitter-video-dl.py https://twitter.com/willowhalliwell/status/1452460936116244482 output_file_name

Done, now you should have an mp4 file of the highest resolution version of that video available.

# Other

I have tested this with the 10 video files listed in test_videos.txt and it seems to work.  Highly possible there are other variants out there that this won't work for.  If you encounter such, please submit an issue and include the URL that doesn't work.  If the script doesn't work double check you have the URL right.
